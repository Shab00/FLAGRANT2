### Feature Engineering
This section focuses on creating new features from the existing ones to potentially improve the model's performance. Two new features are engineered.

### Creating Target Variable and Data Cleaning
This section defines the target variable for the machine learning model and performs some data cleaning.

### Defining the Model Architecture
This code defines a function `get_model` that creates and compiles a neural network model and prints a detailed classification report.

## requirements.txt
Contains the list of required packages for running the Jupyter Notebook.


# Key Metrics

## Precision
- For class 0: 0.95
- For class 1: 0.97

## Recall
- For class 0: 0.97
- For class 1: 0.95

## F1-score
- Both classes: 0.96

## Support
- Class 0: 72 instances
- Class 1: 75 instances

## Accuracy
- 0.96

## Macro avg
- Precision, recall, and F1-score: 0.96

## Weighted avg
- Precision, recall, and F1-score: 0.96

# Overall
The model demonstrates excellent performance with high precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes. The accuracy of 0.96 indicates that the model is highly effective in classifying instances correctly.
